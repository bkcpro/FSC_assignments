          The equilibrium that exists between parts of the earth's crust,
          which behaves as if it consists of blocks floating on the underlying
          mantle, rising if material (such as an ice cap) is removed and sinking
          if material is deposited.

          A lithosphere (Ancient Greek: λίθος [lithos] for "rocky", and σφαίρα [sphaira]
          for "sphere") is the rigid,[1] outermost shell of a terrestrial-type planet or
          natural satellite that is defined by its rigid mechanical properties.

          he mantle is a layer inside a terrestrial planet and some other rocky planetary bodies.
          For a mantle to form, the planetary body must be large enough to have undergone the process
          of planetary differentiation by density.
